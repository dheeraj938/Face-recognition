Using OpenCV and face_recognition for Face Recognition A Python script for face recognition utilizing the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries may be found in this repository. The script records footage from a camera in real-time, identifies faces in the stream, and then compares the faces with previously loaded photos to identify faces that are known to the user.

Features Dynamic Loading: Quickly load several facial pictures for identification. Real-time Face Recognition: Identify faces in live video feeds. Multiple Person Support: Identify and distinguish between several people. Conditions Face recognition in OpenCV Application Install the necessary libraries:

pip install facial recognition for OpenCV in Python

In the script, provide the paths to each person's picture files and corresponding names.

Execute the script:

Face-detect-vdo.py in Python To end the video broadcast, press 'q'.

Contributions that are made are Configuration To improve recognition accuracy, tweak the tolerance option in compare_faces. Contributing: We appreciate your contributions! Please open pull requests and problems.
